# Image Processing.

Processes a directory of images, turning an un-ordered mess, into a nice, date
ordered mess. This was borne of having one too many "Collections" of photos
stored randomly. You need them all in one place right?

-- Requirments;
You'll need PHP installed on whatever machine you're going to run this on. 5.2
at a minimum.

-- Usage:
Simply modify process.php, setting the inputdir, output dir and any of the below:

setDirYear(): Will set "Year" directories (/2010)
setDirMonth(): Will add "Month" directories (/2010/05)
setDirDay(): will set day directories (/2010/05/23)
setImageTypes(): is an array of image extensions you want to use.
setDateStyle(): Use the php date() method of dates style (Y-m-d)


Then, run it like so:
php -f ./process.php

-- Warranties
None. This is an experimental script, if this deletes, or otherwise breaks
your image library, don't come running to me. This can be a destructive
script. USE WITH CAUTION
